Download this git *duh*
Put all your settings and tokens into the `config-example.json` and rename that file to `example.JSON`
Install all dependencies with `npm i` and start it with node!
You should be all set.

## About
This bot provides commands and tools for Discord text channels and guilds.\n
It is written in NodeJS.\n
I started this project so I can learn NodeJS.\n

## My goal
My goal is to try to create a bot that while having fun commands still provides great tools for admins.\n

## Found a bug or want to request a new feature?
Create an issue on this Git with appropriate label.\n

## Want to help?
Simply ask me! I mostly check my email.\n

This README is still WIP
