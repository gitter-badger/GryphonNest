# GryphonBot
## Getting started
Download this git *duh*
Put all your settings and tokens into the `config-example.json` and rename that file to `example.JSON`
Install all dependencies with `npm i` and start it with node!
You should be all set.

## About
This bot provides commands and tools for Discord text channels and guilds.
It is written in NodeJS.
I started this project so I can learn NodeJS.

## My goal
My goal is to try to create a bot that while having fun commands still provides great tools for admins.

## Found a bug or want to request a new feature?
